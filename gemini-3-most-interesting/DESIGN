# Game Title: Geo-Factorum

## Concept
An automation-roguelike hybrid. The player controls a "Fabricator Unit" in a dark, subterranean cavern.

## Core Feedback Loops
1. **Gather**: Mine resources (Redium, Bluestone) manually or with machines.
2. **Automate**: Build Miners to extract, Belts to transport, and Processors to refine.
3. **Survive**: Pollution/Activity attracts "Creeps". Build Turrets to defend the supply line.
4. **Evolve**: Feed resources into the central "Nexus" to level up, unlocking faster machines and combat stats.

## Tech Specs
*   **Engine**: Custom Vanilla JS Grid Engine.
*   **Data Structures**:
    *   `Grid`: 1D Float32Array backed representation for terrain (performance).
    *   `EntityManager`: Spatial Hashing for collision and logic updates of dynamic objects.
    *   `Automata`: System for ticking structures (Belts, Miners).

## MVP Scope
*   Moveable Player.
*   Placeable Conveyor Belts and Miners.
*   Items moving along belts.
*   Resource nodes on the map.
