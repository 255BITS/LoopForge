This is a plan to create a software product in the AI space that makes $1000 / motnh at the end of 3 months. Our unique edges:

* Martyn Garcia- Has a neurosymbolic engine that can be used to parse out rules and facts from pdf docs or similar. This then runs validation on these things by running prolog.
* Mikkel Garcia- Has a agent loop framework that allows creation and improvement of programs and other things. Basically can create a program in a for loop with AI improving over time.
* Gabe Hamilton- Great at organization, prior CTO. Built an agent framework in the past.
* Lee Gonzalez- Thought leader in AI, software engineer by training and very tuned into the latest tech.

We all can contribute but we need easy distribution, a solid pain point or business plan and something that doesnt take much effort.

Last meeting we discussed various things around the upcoming AI disruption. I told Lee about 'project umbrella' which is an effort to give small amounts of ecofriendly crypto to ppl I know.
