- Goal: 100 beta users, 500+ email list from viral thread

**Week 3-4: Project Umbrella Cross-Pollination**
- Gabe activates Project Umbrella contacts (tech-savvy, crypto-adjacent builders)
- Offer "founding member" pricing ($9/mo locked forever) for early adopters
- These users are likely building AI side projects—direct pain point
- Goal: 40 paid founding members ($360 MRR locked in)

**Week 5-8: Developer Community Saturation**
- Publish on Hacker News: "Show HN: We built a linter for AI prompts"
- Post on r/LocalLLaMA, r/ChatGPTCoding, r/MachineLearning
- Create free "Prompt Security Checklist" PDF as lead magnet
- Guest on 2-3 AI podcasts (Latent Space, Practical AI—Lee has connections)
- GitHub: Open-source basic rule set, paid tier for advanced checks
- Goal: 300 sign-ups, 60 paying users

**Week 9-12: Enterprise/Startup Outreach**
- Target AI startups who need to prove prompt safety to customers/investors
- Cold outreach to YC AI companies (compliance angle for fundraising)
- Offer "AgentLint Certified" badge for marketing
- Partner with AI safety consultants as affiliates
- Goal: 5-10 Team tier conversions at $99/mo

### Revenue Model

| Tier       | Price      | Features                                           |
|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Free       | $0         | 5 prompt scans/month, basic contradiction check    |
| Pro        | $19/month  | Unlimited scans, jailbreak testing, export reports |
| Team       | $99/month  | API access, CI/CD integration, audit logs, 10 seats|

**Target for $1000/month:**
- 53 Pro users, OR
- 10 Team users, OR
- Mix (e.g., 30 Pro + 4 Team = $966)

### Technical Architecture (High-Level)

```
[Prompt Upload] → [Martyn's Parser] → [Rule Graph Extraction]
                                             ↓
                                    [Prolog Consistency Check]
                                    (contradictions, ambiguity)
                                             ↓
                                    [Mikkel's Adversarial Agent]
                                    (generates attack prompts)
                                             ↓
                                    [Vulnerability Report]
                                             ↓
                                    [Dashboard + CI/CD Webhook]

### 3-Month Milestones

| Month | Milestone                                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | MVP: paste prompt → get contradiction + basic jailbreak report  |
| 2     | Pro tier, founding members, Lee's launch thread, 100+ users     |
| 3     | HN launch, API/CI integration, Team tier, $1000 MRR             |

### Risks & Mitigations

- **"I can just use ChatGPT for this":** Structured analysis + Prolog logic checking is genuinely different from LLM vibes
- **Niche market:** AI builder market is exploding; even 0.01% penetration = thousands of users
- **Fast-moving space:** Advantage—we're building for builders, can iterate with them
- **Open-source competition:** Lead with speed + polish; open-source basic rules to build trust

## RATIONALE

### Why AgentLint over the other candidates:

**1. Distribution is the hardest startup problem—and we've solved it.**
Lee's AI thought leader status provides free, high-trust distribution to the exact audience that needs this tool. No other candidate has this advantage. ContractLint and ProposalMatch would require building audience from scratch in fragmented markets.

**2. This is our home turf.**
Gabe built an agent framework. Martyn's neurosymbolic engine + Prolog is *purpose-built* for detecting logical contradictions in rule systems—which is exactly what prompts are. FactLint's fact-checking requires solving a much harder technical problem (knowledge bases, real-time web verification). SpecLint is viable but applies our tools to a less natural domain.

**3. Greenfield market with perfect timing.**
There's no dominant player in "prompt linting." ContractLint competes with legal tech incumbents. ProposalMatch competes with PandaDoc. SpecLint enters a crowded PM tools market (acknowledged in its own doc with lower pricing). AgentLint creates a new category.

**4. Tribal identity drives viral growth.**
AI builders share tools compulsively. A single Lee thread can reach 50k+ builders. The "100 prompts analyzed" content practically writes itself. FactLint has viral potential but requires catching external errors (riskier); AgentLint's virality comes from teaching (safer, more sustainable).

**5. Project Umbrella synergy.**
Crypto-adjacent tech builders are exactly the early adopters building AI tools. This channel is strong for AgentLint, weak for all other candidates.

**6. Realistic path to $1000 MRR.**
53 Pro users from a dense, tool-sharing community is achievable. SpecLint needs 67 users at a lower price point in a crowded market. FactLint's enterprise-dependent model is riskier for initial traction.

### The decisive factor:
When distribution is built-in, technical alignment is perfect, and the market is greenfield, you take that bet. AgentLint is the only candidate where all three conditions are true.
