### Risks & Mitigations

- **"Why not just use Perplexity?":** We validate existing content, not generate new; specialized for accuracy
- **Fact-checking is hard:** Start with easily verifiable claims (dates, statistics, quotes)
- **Real-time web access costs:** Cache common facts; charge more for real-time verification
- **Liability concerns:** Terms clearly state "assistance tool"—human review recommended

---

### Why This Might Beat Other Candidates

**1. Massive Market Timing Advantage**
- AI content creation exploded in 2024—every blogger, marketer, journalist uses AI
- Google's March 2024 update specifically targets low-quality AI content
- Major publications (CNET, Sports Illustrated) faced scandals over AI errors
- No dominant player in AI fact-checking yet

**2. Viral Distribution Built-In**
- "AI got this hilariously wrong" content performs incredibly well on social
- Lee can create viral threads showing hallucinations in popular AI content
- Each exposed error becomes marketing for FactLint
- Media loves covering AI accuracy stories—free PR

**3. Immediate, Visceral Pain Point**
- One factual error can destroy a brand's credibility
- SEO rankings tank with inaccurate content (E-E-A-T)
- Legal risk for incorrect medical/financial AI content
- Unlike specs or contracts, content errors are PUBLIC

**4. Perfect Use of Mikkel's Agent Loop**
- Each fact check improves the system's knowledge base
- Agents can learn domain-specific fact patterns
- Continuous improvement = competitive moat

**5. Multiple Revenue Streams**
- SaaS subscriptions (primary)
- API for AI writing tools (Jasper, Copy.ai integration)
- Enterprise white-label
- Potential acquisition by Grammarly, Google, or AI writing platforms
