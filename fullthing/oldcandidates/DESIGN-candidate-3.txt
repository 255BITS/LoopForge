### Product Summary

A tool for AI builders that validates prompt configurations, system messages, and agent instructions for contradictions, edge cases, jailbreak vulnerabilities, and logical inconsistencies. Upload your prompts → get a structured report of issues before deploying.

**Tagline:** "Ship agents with confidence."

### Why This Leverages Our Edges

| Team Member    | Contribution                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Martyn Garcia  | Neurosymbolic engine parses prompts into rule sets, Prolog finds contradictions |
| Mikkel Garcia  | Agent loop generates adversarial test cases, improves detection over time    |
| Gabe Hamilton  | Built agent framework before—deep domain knowledge, architecture lead        |
| Lee Gonzalez   | AI thought leader = instant credibility, direct access to builder community  |

### Distribution Strategy (Specific)

**Week 1-2: Lee's Network + AI Twitter/X**
- Lee tweets thread: "We analyzed 100 production prompts—here's what breaks them"
- Offer free scans to AI builders in Lee's network (DMs, replies)
- Post in AI Discord servers (Latent Space, AI Engineer, Cursor community)
- Goal: 100 beta users, 500+ email list from viral thread

**Week 3-4: Project Umbrella Cross-Pollination**
- Gabe activates Project Umbrella contacts (tech-savvy, crypto-adjacent builders)
- Offer "founding member" pricing ($9/mo locked forever) for early adopters
- These users are likely building AI side projects—direct pain point
- Goal: 40 paid founding members ($360 MRR locked in)

**Week 5-8: Developer Community Saturation**
- Publish on Hacker News: "Show HN: We built a linter for AI prompts"
- Post on r/LocalLLaMA, r/ChatGPTCoding, r/MachineLearning
- Create free "Prompt Security Checklist" PDF as lead magnet
- Guest on 2-3 AI podcasts (Latent Space, Practical AI—Lee has connections)
- GitHub: Open-source basic rule set, paid tier for advanced checks
- Goal: 300 sign-ups, 60 paying users

**Week 9-12: Enterprise/Startup Outreach**
- Target AI startups who need to prove prompt safety to customers/investors
- Cold outreach to YC AI companies (compliance angle for fundraising)
- Offer "AgentLint Certified" badge for marketing
- Partner with AI safety consultants as affiliates
- Goal: 5-10 Team tier conversions at $99/mo

### Revenue Model

| Tier       | Price      | Features                                           |
|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Free       | $0         | 5 prompt scans/month, basic contradiction check    |
| Pro        | $19/month  | Unlimited scans, jailbreak testing, export reports |
| Team       | $99/month  | API access, CI/CD integration, audit logs, 10 seats|

**Target for $1000/month:**
- 53 Pro users, OR
- 10 Team users, OR
- Mix (e.g., 30 Pro + 4 Team = $966)

### Technical Architecture (High-Level)

```
[Prompt Upload] → [Martyn's Parser] → [Rule Graph Extraction]
                                             ↓
                                    [Prolog Consistency Check]
                                    (contradictions, ambiguity)
                                             ↓
                                    [Mikkel's Adversarial Agent]
                                    (generates attack prompts)
                                             ↓
                                    [Vulnerability Report]
                                             ↓
                                    [Dashboard + CI/CD Webhook]

### 3-Month Milestones

| Month | Milestone                                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | MVP: paste prompt → get contradiction + basic jailbreak report  |
| 2     | Pro tier, founding members, Lee's launch thread, 100+ users     |
| 3     | HN launch, API/CI integration, Team tier, $1000 MRR             |

### Risks & Mitigations

- **"I can just use ChatGPT for this":** Structured analysis + Prolog logic checking is genuinely different from LLM vibes
- **Niche market:** AI builder market is exploding; even 0.01% penetration = thousands of users
- **Fast-moving space:** Advantage—we're building for builders, can iterate with them
- **Open-source competition:** Lead with speed + polish; open-source basic rules to build trust

---

### Why This Might Beat Candidates 1 & 2

- **Distribution is built-in:** Lee's thought leader status = free, high-trust distribution channel
- **Tribal identity:** "AI builders" is a strong identity; they share tools with each other constantly
- **Timing:** Market is nascent—no dominant player in "prompt linting" yet
- **Viralilty potential:** Controversial takes on prompt safety → Twitter engagement → sign-ups
- **Project Umbrella synergy:** Crypto/tech folks are exactly the early adopters building AI tools
- **Lower competition:** ContractLint competes with legal tech; ProposalMatch competes with PandaDoc. AgentLint is greenfield.
- **Team credibility:** Gabe built an agent framework, Martyn has neurosymbolic engine—this is our home turf
