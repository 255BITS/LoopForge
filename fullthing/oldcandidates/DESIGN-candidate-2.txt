### Distribution Strategy (Specific)

**Week 1-2: Direct Outreach to Consulting Networks**
- Lee + Gabe tap into consulting Slack communities (Toptal, GLG, consulting subreddits)

- These users submit 10-20 proposals/month, high volume = high pain
- Post in freelancer communities, run small Reddit/Twitter ads ($200 budget)
- Create "Proposal Win Rate Calculator" as lead magnet
- Goal: 300 sign-ups, 30 paying users

### Technical Architecture (High-Level)

```
[RFP Upload] → [Martyn's Engine] → [Requirements Graph]
                                          ↓
[Proposal Upload] → [Section Parser] → [Proposal Graph]
                                          ↓
                                   [Mikkel's Agent Loop]
                                   (maps proposal → requirements)
                                          ↓
                                   [Gap Analysis Engine]
                                          ↓
                                   [Compliance Matrix + Report]

### Risks & Mitigations

- **Document format variety:** Start with PDF/DOCX only, expand later
- **Accuracy of requirement extraction:** Human review step for complex RFPs, improve via Mikkel's loop
- **Niche market:** Freelancer segment adds volume; GovCon adds high-value customers
- **Competition (PandaDoc, etc.):** Position as "compliance-first" not "proposal builder"

---

### Why This Might Beat Candidate 1

- **Higher price tolerance:** Consultants/agencies have budget, contracts are often low-margin freelancers
- **Clearer ROI:** "Win more bids" > "Avoid bad contracts"
- **Repeat usage:** Power users submit 10+ proposals/month vs. occasional contract reviews
- **Built-in urgency:** RFP deadlines create natural purchase triggers
