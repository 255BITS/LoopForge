# DESIGN CANDIDATE 4: SpecLint
## Product Requirements & Specification Validator

---

### Product Summary

A tool for product managers and engineering leads that validates PRDs, product specs, and requirements documents for contradictions, ambiguities, missing edge cases, and logical gaps. Paste your spec → get a structured report of issues before your team starts building the wrong thing.

**Tagline:** "Catch spec bugs before they become code bugs."

### Why This Leverages Our Edges

| Team Member    | Contribution                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Martyn Garcia  | Neurosymbolic engine parses requirements into logical predicates, Prolog detects contradictions |
| Mikkel Garcia  | Agent loop generates "what about X?" edge case questions, improves coverage over time |
| Gabe Hamilton  | Former CTO—personally felt this pain, understands PM↔Eng handoff deeply       |
| Lee Gonzalez   | Tech audience overlap with PM community, credibility for launch content       |

### Distribution Strategy (Specific)

**Week 1-2: Product Hunt Launch + Gabe's Network**
- Product Hunt launch (Tuesday, 12:01 AM PT)—PM community lives there
- Gabe personally emails 50 former colleagues (PMs, eng leads, founders)
- Create "Spec Review Checklist" as free downloadable, capture emails
- Post in "Product Management" and "ProductTank" Slack communities
- Goal: 300 sign-ups from launch week, 50+ email list from checklist

**Week 3-4: Content Play on LinkedIn + Lenny's Newsletter Community**
- Lee writes LinkedIn post: "The 7 spec mistakes that cost startups months"
- Gabe writes "Confessions of a CTO: Specs I wish I'd questioned" (shared in CTO Slack groups)
- Submit to Lenny's Newsletter community Slack for feedback/sharing
- Post in r/ProductManagement, r/startups, r/ExperiencedDevs
- Goal: 200 additional sign-ups, 15-20 paid conversions

**Week 5-8: Notion/Confluence Template Distribution**
- Create "SpecLint-Ready PRD Template" for Notion (free, with SpecLint integration)
- Submit to Notion template gallery (high discovery channel)
- Create Confluence equivalent, post in Atlassian community forums
- Partner with 2-3 popular PM template creators (revenue share for referrals)
- YouTube tutorial: "How to write specs that don't contradict themselves" (SEO play)
- Goal: 500 sign-ups via template discovery, 40 paid users

**Week 9-12: Startup Studio & Accelerator Partnerships**
- Target YC, Techstars, On Deck companies (PMs at early-stage = high pain)
- Offer "Accelerator Partner" pricing: $12/mo for batch companies
- Cold email to startup studio operators: "Your portfolio companies ship faster with validated specs"
- Integrate with Linear/Jira for seamless workflow (feature, not distribution, but increases stickiness)
- Goal: 3 accelerator partnerships, 50+ paid users from this channel

### Revenue Model

| Tier       | Price      | Features                                           |
|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Free       | $0         | 3 spec scans/month, basic contradiction check      |
| Pro        | $15/month  | Unlimited scans, edge case generation, export PDF  |
| Team       | $59/month  | 5 seats, spec versioning, Notion/Linear integration|

**Target for $1000/month:**
- 67 Pro users, OR
- 17 Team users, OR
- Mix (e.g., 30 Pro + 8 Team = $922)

**Note:** Lower Pro price point than other candidates—PM tools market is price-sensitive and crowded. Volume play.

### 3-Month Milestones

| Month | Milestone                                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | MVP: paste spec → get contradiction + edge case report          |
| 2     | Product Hunt launch, Notion template live, 200+ users, first $$ |
| 3     | Team tier, Linear integration, accelerator deals, $1000 MRR     |

### Risks & Mitigations

- **"I can just use ChatGPT":** Structured Prolog analysis catches logical contradictions ChatGPT misses; edge case agent is systematic, not vibes
- **Crowded PM tools market:** Position as "QA for specs" not "another PM tool"—new category
- **Spec format variety:** Start with plain text/Markdown; Notion integration covers 80% of startup PMs
- **Price sensitivity:** Low Pro price + generous free tier builds adoption; monetize on Team/org upgrade

### Why This Might Beat Candidates 1, 2 & 3

| Factor                    | ContractLint | ProposalMatch | AgentLint | **SpecLint** |
|---------------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| TAM size                  | Medium       | Medium        | Growing   | **Large**    |
| Repeat usage frequency    | Low          | Medium        | Medium    | **High**     |
| Gabe's direct experience  | Low          | Low           | High      | **Highest**  |
| Product Hunt fit          | Moderate     | Low           | High      | **Highest**  |
| Template distribution     | None         | None          | Low       | **High**     |
| Price tolerance           | Medium       | High          | High      | Medium       |
| Virality mechanics        | Low          | Low           | High      | **Medium**   |

**Key advantages:**

1. **Gabe's lived experience:** As a former CTO, Gabe personally felt the pain of building from bad specs. Authentic founder-market fit = better product, better marketing copy, better sales conversations.

2. **Template distribution is underrated:** Notion template gallery has millions of monthly visitors. A well-designed "SpecLint PRD Template" can drive thousands of sign-ups passively. No other candidate has this channel.

3. **Product Hunt is home turf:** PM community dominates Product Hunt. AgentLint might do well there, but SpecLint is *perfectly* positioned for that audience.

4. **High repeat usage:** PMs write specs constantly. Unlike contracts (occasional) or RFPs (periodic), specs are weekly/daily artifacts at fast-moving companies.

5. **Clear expansion path:** Start with PRD validation → expand to user stories, technical specs, design docs. Natural upsell to Team tier as org adopts.

### Distribution Advantage Summary

| Channel                  | Candidate 1 | Candidate 2 | Candidate 3 | **Candidate 4** |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Product Hunt             | Moderate    | Weak        | Strong      | **Perfect**     |
| Notion/Template gallery  | None        | None        | None        | **Strong**      |
| Gabe's CTO network       | Weak        | Moderate    | Moderate    | **Perfect**     |
| Lee's tech audience      | Weak        | Weak        | Perfect     | **Strong**      |
| LinkedIn organic         | Low         | Moderate    | High        | **High**        |
| Accelerator partnerships | Weak        | Weak        | Moderate    | **Strong**      |

---

**Bottom line:** SpecLint trades AgentLint's "AI builder" tribal identity for broader PM market + unique Notion distribution channel + Gabe's direct founder-market fit. Lower ceiling but wider floor—more paths to $1000 MRR.
