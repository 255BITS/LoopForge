Runebloom: Idle Realms
======================

High-level pitch
----------------
Runebloom: Idle Realms is a fantasy-themed incremental RPG you can play in the browser.
Click to strike, hire allies for idle DPS, beat bosses every 10 waves to earn **Aspect Shards**,
and invest those shards into elemental Attunements (Fire/Frost/Shadow) for permanent power.
Everything happens in a single-page UI (`index.html`) with autosave, tooltips, and responsive layout.

Core loops
----------
1) **Fight loop**: Attack the current enemy (or let idle DPS work). Earn gold & XP on kill.
2) **Progress loop**: Clear 10 waves → fight a boss. Killing a boss grants 1 Aspect Shard.
3) **Growth loop**: Spend gold on upgrades (click damage, idle DPS, crit…). Spend shards on permanent
   Attunements (Fire = click, Frost = idle, Shadow = crit scaling). Repeat.

Game feel
---------
* Click feels punchy (damage floaters + crit glow).
* Enemies animate using the provided videos. Zone difficulty maps to video `enemy-<powerlevel>.mp4`.
* Numbers scale smoothly with readable abbreviations (K, M, B…).

Balance sketch
--------------
* **Enemy HP**: `25 * 1.2^(stage-1)` (bosses ×4 HP). Stage = (zone-1)*10 + wave.
* **Rewards**: Gold ≈ `5 * 1.15^stage`, XP ≈ `3 * 1.12^stage`, with small randomness.
* **Upgrades**: Exponential pricing (1.15–1.35 multipliers). Early items are cheap and impactful.
* **Attunements**: Each allocated shard boosts:
  - Fire: +5% click damage (multiplicative)
  - Frost: +5% idle DPS (multiplicative)
  - Shadow: +5% critical *multiplier* per shard (starts at ×2 base)

UI
--
* **Header**: Title + compact save indicator.
* **Left panel**: Player stats (Level, XP bar, Health [abstract], Gold, Damage profile).
* **Center**: Enemy video with HP bar overlay, Attack button, floating damage numbers.
* **Right/Tabs**:
  - *Upgrades*: Buyable items with cost scaling & live effects.
  - *Attunements*: Allocate/unallocate shards across Fire/Frost/Shadow (free respec).
  - *Settings*: Autosave toggle, mute video, reset save.

Data & saving
-------------
* LocalStorage key: `runebloom.save.v1`
* Autosaves every ~5s and on page hide/unload.
* Robust loading: guards against malformed saves; defaults are merged forward.

Assets (given)
--------------
* `assets/enemy-<powerlevel>.mp4` where `<powerlevel>` ∈ [0..10]
  - a simple monster is `enemy-0.mp4`
  - videos are looped + muted for background animation

Mapping to difficulty
---------------------
* Zone index → `powerlevel = clamp(0..10, zone-1)`
* Zones beyond 11 reuse `enemy-10.mp4`

Nice-to-haves (later)
---------------------
* More upgrade tiers, relics/augments, timed bosses, daily bounties.
* Offline progress estimator, cloud save.
* Accessibility: reduced motion mode for damage floaters.

Testing notes / bug priorities
------------------------------
* Prevent NaN/Infinity by clamping and validating on load & math ops.
* Ensure multiple event listeners aren’t duplicated across rerenders.
* Cap dt in the main loop to avoid large time skips.
* Video error fallback to `enemy-0.mp4`.
* Never allow negative HP / gold / XP; floor tiny residuals to 0.
* Debounce autosave; wrap JSON parse/stringify in try/catch.

Changelog (this pass)
---------------------
* Replaced placeholder name with **Runebloom: Idle Realms**.
* Implemented playable UI (`index.html`), styles (`styles.css`), and logic (`game.js`).
* Integrated enemy video assets by power level with safe fallback.
* Added upgrades, bosses, aspects (elemental attunements), autosave, and reset.
